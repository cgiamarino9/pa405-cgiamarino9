# Project : Python and Metro

## Research questions
Following our Python bootcamp last week (was it boring? exhilerating? a bit of both?), let's put that programming knowledge into action, using and creating data that reflects a real urban situation.

We start by importing a new module `geopandas`. This is a pretty high level geospatial library, widely used by spatial data scientists all over the world. Don't worry about it too much for now, but know that it allows us to import a variety of spatial data formats, and plot them on a map.
