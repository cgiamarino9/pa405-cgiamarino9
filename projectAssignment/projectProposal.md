# Exploring criminalization of homelessness in LA County
I plan to explore 
## Research question
My research question is: where are EV charging stations located in LA county, and where should more be constructed to improve access? 

## Data sources
In this project, I am looking at [311 complaint data](https://la.myneighborhooddata.org/2024/02/311-service-requests/) from USC. I would also like to map poverty rates using [Census data](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/data/tables.html).

I am done with my project proposal. 

## What I expect to find

I expect to find that lower income communities like Boyle Heights have less access to EV charging stations. I hope that my maps tell policymakers to build more charging stations in specific locations.
